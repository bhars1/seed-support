<p>If you are funding your sale of BTC or ETH from your external naitive blockchain wallet, you will be limited by their respective blockchain speed and the fees that you have offered for the transaction. Should you select fees which are lower than average, you run the risk of the transaction being stuck in the queue for hours, days or indefinitely. The fees required will vary on each blockchain depending on how busy it is and the urgency of the other transactions.
